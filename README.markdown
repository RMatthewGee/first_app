# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) 
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

Supreme thank you to Chris Zacharias (Zacman85) without whom I would have never made it past even the initial install.

Welcome to the start of something new.

I can't believe I sold Call of Duty:Black Ops for this...I'm still debating which one is more aggravating.
